Options:

  Platform: Illumina
  # Quality offset for Phred scores, either 33 (Sanger/Illumina 1.8+)
  # or 64 (Illumina 1.3+ / 1.5+). For Bowtie2 it is also possible to
  # specify 'Solexa', to handle reads on the Solexa scale. This is
  # used during adapter-trimming and sequence alignment
  QualityOffset: 33
  # Split a lane into multiple entries, one for each (pair of) file(s)
  # found using the search-string specified for a given lane. Each
  # lane is named by adding a number to the end of the given barcode.

  # Mark / filter PCR duplicates. If set to 'filter', PCR duplicates are
  # removed from the output files; if set to 'mark', PCR duplicates are
  # flagged with bit 0x400, and not removed from the output files; if set to
  # 'no', the reads are assumed to not have been amplified. Collapsed reads
  # are filtered using the command 'paleomix rmdup_duplicates', while "normal"
  # reads are filtered using Picard MarkDuplicates.
  PCRDuplicates: no

  # Command-line options for mapDamage; note that the long-form
  # options are expected; --length, not -l, etc. Uncomment the
  # "mapDamage" line adding command-line options below.

    # when running mapDamage; remove to use all hits

    # To disable mapDamage, write 'no'; to generate basic mapDamage plots,
    # write 'plot'; to build post-mortem damage models, write 'model',
    # and to produce rescaled BAMs, write 'rescale'. The 'model' option
    # includes the 'plot' output, and the 'rescale' option includes both
    # 'plot' and 'model' results. All analyses are carried out per library.
    mapDamage: plot

  # is used in summary statistics and as part of output filenames.
  grasshopperRef:
    # Replace 'PATH_TO_PREFIX' with the path to .fasta file containing the
    # references against which reads are to be mapped. Using the same name

    # (Optional) Uncomment and replace '/dss/dsshome1/lxc07/ru87mis2/diego/cov/blasttarget.bed' with the path to a
    # .bed file listing extra regions for which coverage / depth statistics
